            You are a branch growing from a tree, an unstoppable branch that is
            set out to bear fruit. You will not be cut down nor cast into the
            fire, the axe will not come any close to you. You are mighty vessel
            in the hands of your Father and maker, one to make war with. The
            Lord's hands are outstretched through you, so that the world will
            see and give glory to God.
            <br />
            <br />I see you rise like an edifice, so tall that it literally
            reaches the heavens, that is a sign that no scheme of man or plot of
            satan and his demons can stop you. You are force that will push back
            the advances of the enemy. All he has done to your loved ones and
            family members will be undone as you mount wings to fly higher into
            the realms of the Spirit, through your prayer life.
            <br /> <br />
            The Lord has created a space for you in your generation, so that
            your voice will echo in the hearts of men, turning them from
            darkness to light, from the power of the enemy to the power of God,
            from the shackles of death and hell to the freedom and liberation of
            the Spirit. O man of God, only if you knew how strong God's grace is
            upon your life, only if you knew what terror you are to the enemy. O
            that the Lord may open your eyes to see his investments upon your
            life.
            <br /> <br />
            Tarry a little longer, all that you are demanding to see and
            experience will soon come to pass: the anointing, grace for healing
            and deliverance, the tangible presence of God, the intense prayer
            culture, etc. All of these will come when the Lord deems it fit to
            release them, just be patient. The one whom the Lord will use must
            wear patience as a cloak, for this is what shields him from being
            lured into the danger zone, through the lies of the enemy and the
            scouring tongues of men.
            <br /> <br />I hear the Lord say, be patient and enjoy the process.
            Seek intimacy and enjoy every bit of it. Never be pressurized into
            experiencing certian dimensions of God, you may not be prepared for
            the level of attacks that come with it, and an unprepared man will
            not survive the fiery darts of the enemy that shall be launched
            against him. Stay with God, stay focused, stay consecrated and stay
            in prayer. With all of these you are already a victor. God bless you
